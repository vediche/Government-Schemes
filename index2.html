                Welfare state, concept of government in which the state or a well-established network of social
institutions play a key role in the protection and promotion of the economic and social well-being of citizens.
It is based on the principles like equality of opportunity, equitable distribution of wealth, and public
responsibility for those unable to avail themselves of the minimal provisions for a good life. The general
term may cover a variety of forms of economic and social organization. A fundamental feature of the welfare
schemes is social insurance, a provision common to most advanced industrialized countries (e.g., National
Insurance in the United Kingdom and Social Security in the United States). Such insurance is usually
financed by compulsory contributions and is intended to provide benefits to persons and families during
periods of greatest need. It is widely recognized, however, that in practice the cash benefits fall considerably
short of the levels intended by the designers of the plans. The welfare state also usually includes public
provision of basic education, health services, and housing (in some cases at low cost or without charge). This
paper starts out with a brief discussion of Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy welfare schemes in Andhra Pradesh and
it also summarizes its major achievements in terms of economic efficiency and distribution.
YSRCP leader YS Jagan Mohan Reddy promised to deliver ‘Rajanna Rajyam’ (welfare regime of his
father Y.S. Rajasekar Reddy in A.P during 2004-09) to the people of Andhra Pradesh, subsequently riding
to power on this plank with a massive mandate in the 2019 state elections. Jagan Mohan Reddy chief of
YSRCP has come up with an elaborate model of governance comprised of 9 broad welfare schemes called
the ‘NAVARATNALU’. Navaratnalu is a Concept coined by the Government to improve the delivery
systems and improve the quality of the Governance in the state. It is designed to improve the living standards
of the people. These nine large welfare programs plan to offer benefits worth a minimum of Rs.1lakh to
5lakh per year to various sections of A.P people like the poor, students, children, women, farmers, laborers,
old, disabled, etc. covering various sectors like health, education, agriculture, irrigation, employment and so
on. The concept of Navaratnalu was introduced for building effective social infrastructure which was an
imperative for registering consistent progress in strategic development goals. “Nava Ratnalu (nine jewels)
programme taken up by the chief minister was devised to prioritize welfare of all sections of people,
particularly the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, BCs, EBCs and minorities to increase their per capita
income through these initiatives.

Andhra Pradesh Government schemes list 2023 and latest updates and news about new and upcoming social welfare schemes of YSR led AP govt in 2023. Complete list of Sarkari Yojana launched by Andhra Pradesh Government in 2023 and earlier.

Andhra Pradesh Government has launched several welfare schemes for the state residents including schemes for women, pensioners, youth, farmers, entrepreneurs, labourers and students belonging to every category of the society. Here is the complete list of Andhra Pradesh Government Schemes.
A participant was considered aware of any social welfare scheme if s/he knew the name of the particular scheme launched by the government. If the participant was availing or had availed monetary benefit from any of the social welfare schemes, it was classified as utilizing the social welfare schemes. A participant was considered economically independent if his/her source of personal income or any monetary benefit from the social welfare scheme was perceived to be sufficient to maintain himself/herself. The participant was considered partially dependent if he/she had some personal income or any monetary benefit from the social welfare scheme, but which was not perceived to be sufficient to maintain himself/herself. The participant was classified as economically dependent if there was no personal income or monetary benefit from any social welfare scheme and s/he was totally dependent on other family members. 
Past occupation before 60 years of life was recorded for the major occupation.

All the filled semi-structured interview schedule forms were checked by the Principal Investigator for completeness 
and coherence before data entry. Data were entered in Epi Info 
7. Participant's demographic and socioeconomic characteristics are described with proportions or means wherever applicable. Crude and multivariable logistic regression models were developed to assess the association between utilization of social welfare schemes and sociodemographic factors. A P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The analyses were carried out using Stata 12.0 (Stata Corp LP, College Station, Texas, USA). The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants after providing information about the purpose of the study and an information sheet in Hindi. This study was funded by the Intramural Research Grant of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.

				  <font size="3">The government policy can influence how much tax the community pays, pensions, immigration status and laws, penalties for violation of rules, education system, commerce and trade in an economy.

The government implements a policy that changes social behaviour in the business environment. 
The government can enter into agreements to develop new technology that will bring the necessary change. Reduction in private investments shrinks production of goods and services. That, in turn, may lead to the elimination of jobs.

Government policy can influence interest rates, a rise in which increases the borrowing cost. 
Higher rates will lead to decreased consumer spending, but Lower interest rates attract investment as businesses increase production.

Jalayagnam or Jala Yagnam, (water worship), is a water management program in India. It has been

promise to the farmers of the state to bring 8.2 million acres (8.2 million acres) under irrigation in five years.
The concept of Jalayagnam was aimed at providing a permanent solution to drought and floods. The
Government always feels that if the farmer is happy then the State will flourish. This project has the capacity
to redraw the contours of the State itself. Under this scheme, lakhs of families would be benefited by the
irrigation projects. Completion of Polavaram project on a war footing is promised.</li></font size=>
<li><font color="red"><font size="10">5. Ban on Alcohol</font color></font size>
<font size="5">
The YSRCP promises to put in place a ban on sale of alcohol across the State because Liquor is one
of the main reasons for dispute in families due to which human relations are collapsing. Sale of alcohol will
be banned in 3 stages and availability of alcohol use to be limited to 5-star hotels only. The plan is to ban its
sales totally, but in a phased manner. If all goes to plan, the state should be liquor-free by 2024, well in time
for the next legislative assembly election. Andhra Pradesh will join only four other Indian states-Gujarat,
Mizoram, Bihar and Nagaland- in banning the bottle.</font size=>
Phases of Ban
 Jagan Reddy's plan is to introduce prohibition in a phased manner. In the first step, the Andhra
Pradesh government has taken over retail sales, reduced the number of liquors vends from 4,380 to
3,500 across the state and made the state-owned AP State Beverages Corporation the sole supplier
from October.
 To gradually cut availability and consumption, liquor shops will stay open from 10 am to 9 pm only,
which will be reduced progressively to just a few hours a day. Official estimates of consumption
suggest that liquor sales in the state is already down 18 per cent since Reddy came to power in May</li>

				The Navaratnalu (nine jewels) welfare schemes and a slew of other populist schemes that began
during the first year of the YSRCP coming to power have picked up pace during the second year of Y.S.
Jagan’s rule, the corona-virus (Covid-19) pandemic notwithstanding, consolidating his vote bank and
fetching him tremendous mileage in the local body elections. Apart from direct benefit transfer (DBT)
schemes like Amma Vodi (cash incentive to women who send their children to schools), enhanced pensions,
fee reimbursement scheme, YSR Zero Interest Scheme, etc. that were introduced in the first year, Reddy
came up with a calendar of various other welfare schemes for farmers, weavers, lawyers, autorickshaw
drivers, hawkers, fishermen etc., covering every section of the population, to increase the YSRCP’s vote
bank.
The distribution of 2,500,000 housing sites for economically weaker sections of the population on
December 25, 2020, brought Y.S. Jagan massive goodwill. It was a sort of social engineering by Y.S. Jagan’s,
who ensured that not a single section of people is left out in the implementation of welfare schemes. He even
covered upper castes like Brahmins, Kapus and Reddys, besides minorities. The establishment of village and
ward secretariats to bring the administration to the villages and towns firmly entrenched the YSRCP at the
grassroots level. Over 300,000 village and ward volunteers, who were appointed to deliver the benefits of
various government schemes, be it pensions or ration, directly to the beneficiaries at their doorsteps, proved
a masterstroke for him. The two-year rule of Y.S. Jagan’s government, fulfil over 90%
